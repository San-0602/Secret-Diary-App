# Secret-Diary-App
Secret Diary App ðŸ“” This is a simple yet secure Android application designed to act as a secret diary. The app allows users to store their secrets and view them later by entering a password. The secrets are "encrypted" (via a simple Caesar cipher for fun), and the app provides a playful, yet secure way to keep your thoughts hidden.

Features:

Password Protection: Set a secret password to unlock the diary.

Save Secrets: Write and save your secrets securely.

View Secrets: Unlock and view your stored secrets by entering the correct password.

Fun Encryption: Secrets are scrambled using a Caesar cipher (shifted by 3 for added mystery).

Sleek UI: Minimalist and user-friendly design for an enjoyable experience.

How It Works:

Users can enter a password and unlock the diary.

Once unlocked, the user can save their secrets.

To access a saved secret, the user must re-enter the correct password.

The correct password is :OpenSesame (You can change the password.)

If the password is incorrect, a fun error message is displayed.

Technologies Used:

Android Studio for building the app.

Java for logic implementation.

XML for the UI design.

Setup:

Clone the repository.

Open it in Android Studio.

Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

Enjoy....your secrets.
